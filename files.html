      Wow here we are having another beautiful element which will help
      us type anything we want and that the format we want for our text is not
      disturbed, This can be acheived by typing the text we want in these 
      marverlous tags called the &lt;pre&gt; 
      These tags will help us alot when we want a text in a specific format 
      and the format we want to apply for our text 
      One thing strange that I noted in these new tags is that the style 
      of the font is something like that of the old times telegraph
      I hope this can be changed in the style options, becuase I don't like
      this style at all, 
      Any way; Let's see

      Wow! As you can see that the font-stlyle has been completely changed
      to our old friend the "New Roman Times" which I like the most.
      We are good friends

      non.And this is style I want for my paragraph to appear when ever I want
      to add a new line or when ever I want to add many spaces by that is all
      just to my willing and wishes The computer has no paragraph design or
      layout at all when I add some text to my webpage, so this is all due to
      the usage of the white-space And the white-space and the white_space so
      when white_space is used it is kinda attribute, all the attributes need
      some sort of values too the values for the white_space is to be set to pre
      or preserve so that it means the paragrapg style is to be preserved by the
      web browsers This is what I have wanted since ever, because I want my
      documents according to the style I choose for them Lastly; let's once
      again see how just the white_space works? "white-space: pre/preserve" The
      difference between pre and preserve is just abbreviation
